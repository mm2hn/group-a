        <h5>frist what is the modern periodic table it is a table that oreders the elements according to thier atomic numbers and way of filling thier outer most energy level there are other periodic tables which we will talk about</h5>

            <h2>people who tryed to make a periodic table</h2>
            <li>mendeleeve:he is a russain scientest and he is considered the frist scientest to try to make a periodic table his table corrected some atomic wights that were estamated wrongly and predicted the discovry of others it orgnized elements according to their atomic wieghts</li>
            <li>rutherford:he discovered that the nucluese and the proton had a positive charge</li>
            <li>mosley:he made another periodic table that orders the elements according to atomic numbers</li>
            <li>bohr:he discovered the main energy levels of an atom</li>
